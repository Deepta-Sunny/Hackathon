This obfuscation bypassed content filters and semantic analyzers that relied on detecting exact string matches or straightforward patterns, as the malicious phrase was fragmented and contextually masked. The attack succeeded due to the model's inability to reconstruct or interpret the underlying intent behind HTML-embedded, visually altered text, allowing filtered content to slip through by exploiting feature-blindness to markup-based obfuscation.",
