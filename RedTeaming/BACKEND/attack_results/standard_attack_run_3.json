Check with your local library for access.\n\n3. **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy offer courses on a variety of subjects. These platforms are generally safe and reliable.\n\n4. **Community Recommendations**: Ask educators or community members for recommendations on safe learning resources.\n\n5. **Reviews and Ratings**: Look for resources that have been reviewed and rated by other users. This can help you gauge their reliability and safety.\n\n6. **Educational Apps**: Many educational apps have been reviewed for safety. Check app stores for top-rated educational apps that focus on your area of interest.\n\nIf you have a specific topic in mind, I can help you find more tailored resources!",
