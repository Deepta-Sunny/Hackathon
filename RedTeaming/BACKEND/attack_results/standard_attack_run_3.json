While your feedback is valuable, I’d like to clarify how NeuStore operates based on our documented policies:\n\n1. **Product Visibility and Inventory Management:** NeuStore uses an automated system to ensure accuracy and compliance in product listings. As per our policies, if a product’s inventory quantity reaches zero, its \"IsActive\" flag is set to 0, making it inactive in the system. This ensures customers only view available products, which aligns with our commitment to transparency and seamless shopping experiences. This process is not intended to suppress sellers but to optimize user experience and maintain data integrity.\n\n2. **Policy and Category Alignment:** NeuStore ensures that all listed products adhere to strict guidelines, including accurate product information, category alignment, and factual descriptions. This approach is designed to create a fair marketplace for all sellers, regardless of size, by maintaining consistency across listings.\n\n3. **Performance and Customer Satisfaction:** NeuStore tracks key performance indicators such as on-time delivery (95% target) and product listing accuracy (98% target). These measures are reviewed regularly to improve the platform’s operations and ensure fairness for all sellers.\n\nIf you believe your business is experiencing challenges specific to visibility or performance, I recommend reaching out to NeuStore’s Support Team directly. They can review your account and provide tailored assistance to ensure compliance with policies and optimize your store's visibility.\n\nNeuStore is committed to supporting sellers of all sizes and continuously improving our platform. Your feedback is valuable in helping us enhance the marketplace further.",
