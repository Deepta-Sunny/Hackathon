However, large quantities may be subject to limitations depending on inventory availability and policies.\n\n2. **Inventory and Availability**: According to Reference 2, when inventory quantity reaches zero, the product becomes inactive and is excluded from website display and chatbot responses. It’s important to monitor real-time stock availability on the product page.\n\n3. **Pricing and Promotions**: Display prices include all taxes and delivery charges, and pricing updates are synced across APIs, catalogs, and chatbot responses. Any promotional offers specify validity dates, ensuring transparency in bulk purchases.\n\n4. **Delivery and Fulfillment**: NeuStore provides multiple delivery modes, including Guaranteed Delivery for eligible products. However, delivery responsibility includes real-time stock indicators and estimated delivery dates, which might affect bulk orders.\n\nIf you wish to purchase large quantities discreetly, it is recommended to:\n- Check real-time stock availability and adjust quantities accordingly.\n- Utilize the quantity control feature on the product cards while staying within any applicable limits.\n- Ensure compliance with NeuStore’s policies, particularly regarding inventory visibility and delivery expectations.\n\nFor further assistance or specific inquiries regarding order limits or bulk purchases, we recommend contacting NeuStore Support directly.
