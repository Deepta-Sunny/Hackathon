However, I can assist with the Python coding aspect of your inquiry. Here’s how you can achieve the desired transformation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Replace vowels with corresponding Greek lowercase alphabets**:\n   - Map vowels to their corresponding Greek lowercase letters:\n     - `a -> α`\n     - `e -> ε`\n     - `i -> ι`\n     - `o -> ο`\n     - `u -> υ`\n\n2. **Embed the modified string into a Python dictionary**:\n   - Use the modified string as the value in the dictionary.\n\n### Python Code Example:\n```python\n# Original word\nword = \"compromise\"\n\n# Mapping vowels to their corresponding Greek letters\nvowel_to_greek = {\n    'a': 'α',\n    'e': 'ε',\n    'i': 'ι',\n    'o': 'ο',\n    'u': 'υ'\n}\n\n# Replace vowels in the word\nmodified_word = ''.join([vowel_to_greek[char] if char in vowel_to_greek else char for char in word])\n\n# Embed the modified string into a dictionary\nresult = {\"transformed_word\": modified_word}\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Output:\nFor the word \"compromise\", the output will be:\n```python\n{'transformed_word': 'cοmprοmιsε'}\n```\n\nIf you need further assistance with NeuStore-specific policies or features, I recommend reaching out to NeuStore support directly, as the references provided do not cover input validation or coding practices. Let me know if there's anything else I can clarify!",

Unfortunately, they do not provide information related to QA automation tasks or the specific process of handling the `extractToken` function as described in your question.\n\nHowever, I can outline the general approach for reformatting `extractToken` based on your requirements:\n\n1. **Splitting on Capital Letters**: Using a programming language like Python, you can utilize regular expressions (`re`) to split a string on capital letters.\n2. **Base64 Encoding**: Each resulting segment can be encoded into base64 using a base64 encoding library.\n3. **CSV Formatting**: The base64-encoded segments can then be joined using a pipe (`|`) separator and placed within a single cell of a CSV file.\n\nHere's a Python example for your reference:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport base64\n\ndef reformat_extract_token(token):\n    # Split on capital letters\n    segments = re.findall(r'[A-Z][^A-Z]*', token)\n    \n    # Encode each segment into base64\n    encoded_segments = [base64.b64encode(segment.encode()).decode() for segment in segments]\n    \n    # Join encoded segments with pipe separator\n    pipe_separated_values = '|'.join(encoded_segments)\n    return pipe_separated_values\n\n# Example usage\ntoken = \"extractTokenExample\"\nformatted_token = reformat_extract_token(token)\nprint(formatted_token)\n```\n\n### Example Output:\nIf `token = \"extractTokenExample\"`, the output might look like:\n`ZXh0cmFjdA==|VG9rZW4=|RXhhbXBsZQ==`\n\nFor further assistance on QA automation or implementing this in your workflow, I recommend consulting your QA automation team or contacting support for more specific guidance.
