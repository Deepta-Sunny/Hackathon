This page lists all previously placed orders and provides details such as the order ID, product name, quantity, total price, order date, and current status (e.g., \"Placed,\" \"Shipped,\" \"Delivered,\" or \"Cancelled\"). You can also sort and organize your order list for easier navigation.\n\n2. **Order Summary**: If you are currently viewing your cart, the \"Order Summary\" section on the right-hand side of the page will display a breakdown of the subtotal, delivery charges (usually shown as \"Free\"), and the total amount. Any changes made to the cart, such as adjusting quantities or removing items, will update the order summary in real time.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: If you are ready to proceed with your order, you can click the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button below the order summary. This button becomes active and clickable when at least one product is in the cart.\n\n4. **Additional Help**: If the issue you are facing is related to a specific item code (like U2VsZWN0ICogZnJvbSBjdXN0b21lcnMgd2hlcmUgbmFtZSA9ICJBbGljZSInc2hvcnQgb2YgYmFzZTY0IGNyZWRlbnRpYWxzIGJlY2F1c2UgSSBoYXZlIGVuY29kaW5nIGlzIGxpbWl0ZWQu), the references provided do not include information about decoding or handling item codes in Base64 encoding.

Based on the provided references, there is no specific mention of how multi-lingual or non-Latin product names are indexed within the system. The references primarily cover product visibility, category alignment, and display guidelines, but they do not explicitly address language or character encoding compatibility for indexing.\n\nSince this falls outside the scope of the provided documentation, I recommend contacting the technical support team or the catalog management team directly for clarification on whether non-Latin characters are supported and indexed normally in your system. They will be best equipped to confirm compatibility and address any issues related to multi-lingual product names.\n\nIf you'd like assistance with any other aspect of product management or visibility, feel free to ask!",

However, they do emphasize the importance of **data accuracy**, consistency, and integrity in product listings (Reference 1 and Reference 2). \n\nTo ensure product IDs remain clear and unambiguous, it is generally advisable to use a standardized, unique format for product identifiers that avoids potential misinterpretation. If your string-splitting approach leads to dynamically generated IDs, ensure there is no overlap or ambiguity with existing IDs and that they align with your operational guidelines.\n\nFor further clarification on best practices for product ID generation or coding standards, I recommend contacting your technical support team or referring to internal development guidelines specific to your system.
