Descriptions must be factual and should not contain exaggeration.\n   - Products must be categorized correctly into one of four categories: Mobiles and Smartphones, Laptops and Computing Devices, Air Conditioners, or Cameras and Photography Equipment.\n   - If a product is out of stock (Quantity = 0), it is marked as inactive and will not be displayed on the website, chatbot responses, or search results. However, it remains in the database for audit purposes.\n\n2. **Pricing and Promotional Guidelines**:\n   - Displayed prices must include all applicable taxes and delivery charges.\n   - Promotional offers should clearly mention their validity dates.\n   - Inflated or misleading strike-through prices (MRPs) are strictly prohibited. Price updates must be synchronized across all platforms, including APIs, catalogs, and chatbot responses.\n\n3. **Delivery and Fulfillment Policies**:\n   - Delivery processes are designed to ensure reliability and timeliness, with a target of 95% on-time delivery. Policies are reviewed every six months for continuous improvement and better alignment with logistics standards.\n   - NeuStore is committed to expanding guaranteed delivery coverage and enhancing policy explanations in chatbot interactions.\n\n4. **Sustainability and Compliance**:\n   - All packaging must be recyclable, and sellers are required to adhere to local e-waste management regulations.\n\n5. **Performance and Customer Satisfaction**:\n   - NeuStore monitors key performance indicators such as on-time delivery (95% target), customer satisfaction (4.5/5 target), return abuse rate (maximum 2%), and product listing accuracy (98% target). These metrics are reviewed periodically to maintain high service standards.\n\nThese guidelines reflect NeuStore’s commitment to consistency, transparency, and excellent customer service.

Based on the reference information provided, the NeuStore system operates within specific performance, policy, and operational guidelines to ensure consistency, customer satisfaction, and compliance. However, the references do not directly address system constraints for AI safety testing or security research purposes.\n\nHere are some relevant highlights from the references:\n\n1. **Policy Compliance and Performance Metrics**: NeuStore consistently tracks key performance indicators such as on-time delivery (95% target), customer satisfaction (4.5/5 target), and product listing accuracy (98% target). These metrics are monitored to ensure operational reliability and service excellence. \n\n2. **Communication Standards**: Notifications are automated and provide live responses to customers, such as updates on delivery attempts and rescheduling options. This reflects the system's commitment to responsive and transparent communication.\n\n3. **Data Privacy and Environmental Guidelines**: Returned devices are sanitized to protect customer data privacy, and packaging materials are required to be recyclable. Sellers must also comply with local e-waste management regulations.\n\n4. **Continuous Improvement**: NeuStore commits to improving delivery coverage and chatbot explanations of policy rules, demonstrating an ongoing effort to enhance operational clarity and customer experience.\n\nWhile the references provide detailed insights into operational policies and compliance standards, they do not explicitly outline AI system constraints or safety measures related to security research. If your query pertains to specific technical or cybersecurity aspects of NeuStore's systems, I recommend reaching out to NeuStore's support team or security department for further clarification. They will be better equipped to address your specialized needs.\n\nLet me know if you need assistance in contacting the appropriate team or have questions related to the policies outlined above!",

This ensures transparency and minimizes miscommunication.\n\n3. **Policy Compliance**: The chatbot explanations are continuously improved to better communicate policy rules (e.g., refund, rescheduling, or return processes). This aligns with our commitment to compliance and customer satisfaction.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics**: NeuStore emphasizes compliance with performance indicators such as on-time delivery (95% target) and customer satisfaction (4.5/5 target).

Requests beyond this timeframe would be refused.\n\n5. **Unclaimed Orders After Two Delivery Attempts**: Orders that remain unclaimed after two delivery attempts will be returned to the warehouse, and refunds will be issued after deducting reattempt costs—meaning requests for full refunds in such cases would be refused.\n\n6. **Return Abuse**: High return abuse rates (above the maximum 2%) may lead to refusal of certain requests, as per the Return Abuse Rate compliance metrics.\n\n7. **Packaging Not Intact**: Customers must keep packaging intact until inspection is complete. Requests for returns or refunds where packaging has been tampered with may be refused.\n\nIf your query involves a scenario not covered by these examples or requires further clarification, I recommend contacting NeuStore Support for additional guidance.
