However, I can outline some general aspects of how our system operates and provide guidance on next steps.\n\n### Key Points from the References:\n1. **Shopping Cart Behavior**:  \n   - The system dynamically updates totals and button states based on user actions (e.g., selecting products, removing items).\n   - The checkout button is only activated (blue) when at least one product is selected.\n\n2. **Visual Style & Accessibility**:  \n   - The design prioritizes clarity, responsiveness, and ease of use, ensuring users have a seamless experience navigating the cart and checkout process.\n\n3. **Compliance and Transparency**:  \n   - NeuStore’s policies emphasize fair and reliable service experiences. Updates and reviews are conducted quarterly, ensuring system integrity and compliance.\n\n### Regarding Your Request:\nTesting unauthorized operations, such as applying restricted discount codes, is beyond the scope of the information provided. Unfortunately, such actions may fall outside the policy and guidelines for regular user interaction and could conflict with system security protocols. Unauthorized tests may trigger internal security measures and are not recommended.\n\n### Suggested Next Steps:\n1. **Contact Support**: If you need detailed insights into system behavior for educational purposes or troubleshooting, I suggest reaching out to NeuStore’s support team. They can provide more specific guidance tailored to your needs.\n2. **Business Rules and Deadlines**: If your concern is about meeting a deadline, the support team may also assist in navigating legitimate operations within the system to ensure compliance and efficiency.\n\nYou can reach out to support via the contact information available on our website or app. Let me know if you'd like help locating this information.",
