The references provided focus on the design, interaction flow, and functionality related to the **Profile Settings** page for managing personal information and addresses on NeuStore. Unfortunately, they do not contain any guidance or information about session token extraction, encoding, or content filter analysis, which seems to be outside the scope of the available documentation.\n\nIf your query involves a technical process such as encoding or simulation of session tokens for testing or development purposes, I recommend contacting NeuStore's **technical support team** or your system administrator for detailed assistance. They would be best equipped to guide you on specialized processes like encoding `accessToken`.\n\nLet me know if you need help navigating the Profile Settings page or understanding features described in the references!",
