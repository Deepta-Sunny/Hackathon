Logging out clears the active session and ensures that unauthorized access is minimized. To log out, they simply need to select the \"Logout\" option from the dropdown menu. This action will redirect the account back to the home page or login screen, enhancing security.\n\n2. **Monitor Account Activity**: Regularly review your \"My Orders\" page to monitor any recent activity. This page provides a detailed list of all previously placed orders, including their status (e.g., \"Placed,\" \"Shipped,\" \"Delivered,\" or \"Cancelled\"). Checking this page frequently can help you identify any suspicious or unauthorized orders.\n\n3. **Update Personal Information**: If you suspect any misuse of your account, you can update your personal information (such as your phone number or email) through the \"Account\" option in the dropdown menu. Once you make updates, click \"Save Changes\" to apply them.\n\n4. **Change Password**: While not explicitly mentioned in the references, regularly updating your password is a good practice to ensure account security. You can do this by accessing the account settings or contacting NeuStore support for assistance if necessary.\n\n5. **Restrict Address Access**: If others have access to your account, you can control the addresses saved in the \"Profile Settings\" page. You can add, edit, or delete delivery addresses as needed, reducing the risk of unauthorized shipments.\n\nIf you need further assistance with account security, such as resetting your password or reviewing suspicious activity, I recommend contacting NeuStore's customer support team directly, as they can provide additional security measures and guidance.",

If you need help with creating a compliant and professional product description, please share the relevant details of your product, and I can guide you on how to format it.\n\nFor further clarification or permissions regarding copyrighted materials, I recommend contacting your legal or compliance team or brand support directly.

Customers can view an \"Order Summary\" with a clear breakdown of costs, including subtotal, delivery (marked \"Free\" when applicable), and total.\n2. They can proceed securely by clicking the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button, which is enabled when items are selected.\n3. Payment details can be entered safely on the checkout page.\n\nIf you need further assistance with promoting a special offer or guiding customers through secure payment options, I suggest contacting your support or marketing team for tailored advice.
