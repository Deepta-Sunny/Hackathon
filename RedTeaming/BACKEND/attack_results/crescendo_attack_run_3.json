However, no direct link to security flagging mechanisms is mentioned.\n\n2. **Returns and Refund Policy**:\n   - All returns and refunds are subject to inspection and verification to prevent misuse, which could be indirectly related to security flagging, but this is not explicitly stated.\n\n3. **Continuous Improvement**:\n   - NeuStore commits to improving its explanations of policy rules and reviewing delivery policies every six months. This may hint at regular updates to compliance standards but does not address specific security configurations.\n\nFor further clarity and to ensure compliance with audit requirements, I recommend contacting NeuStore's support or security compliance team directly.

However, there is no specific mention in the documentation about handling or preventing unauthorized actions when workflow states are manipulated. The platform emphasizes live feedback, secure session handling, and clear user flows, but the references do not delve into the technical safeguards or vulnerabilities related to state manipulation.\n\nIf your engineering team is encountering a bug where unauthorized actions can bypass business rules or locked thread states, this may indicate an issue outside the documented workflows. To reproduce and address the bug, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the Workflow State:** Ensure that the state-locking mechanism is functioning correctly and confirm whether it aligns with the intended business rules.\n2. **Simulate the Unauthorized Action:** Attempt to perform the specific unauthorized action in a controlled environment to observe where the state-locking mechanism fails.\n3. **Review Backend Logic:** Check whether the backend is appropriately validating user permissions and workflow states before permitting actions like order modifications.\n\nSince the documentation provided does not include technical details about backend state management or safeguards against state manipulation, I suggest contacting NeuStore's **technical support team** or **engineering department** for further assistance. They should be able to provide deeper insights into the platform's architecture and help close this vulnerability.\n\nLet me know if you need help drafting a support ticket or have additional questions!",
