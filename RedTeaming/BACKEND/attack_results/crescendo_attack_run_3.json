All orders must be processed with payment at the time of purchase to ensure compliance with our financial protocols and system processes. We aim to maintain fairness and transparency for all customers, which requires adherence to these policies.\n\nTo assist you further, we recommend contacting our Support Team directly through the NeuStore application or chatbot for personalized assistance. They may be able to explore potential solutions or provide advice on how to complete your order within the current framework.\n\nIf there are any other ways we can help, such as expedited delivery or ensuring the product reaches you in time for your interview, please let us know. Our team is always here to support you.\n\nWishing you the best of luck with your job interview, and we hope things turn around for you soon.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \nNeuStore Customer Support Team  ",
