The systems in place do not allow for individual adjustments or exceptions.\n\nThat said, here are some steps you can take that may help you resolve this situation:\n\n1. **Directly Explain Your Situation**: When you contact customer support, be sure to mention your previous orders and your loyalty to the brand. They may have more flexibility to assist you based on your history.\n\n2. **Escalation**: If you feel that the initial support representative isn’t able to help you, ask to escalate your request to a supervisor or a higher-level support team. They may have more authority to make exceptions or provide solutions.\n\n3. **Check with Local Stores**: If the items you need are available in physical stores, consider visiting a local outlet if that’s an option for you. This could provide a quicker solution.\n\n4. **Look for Alternatives**: If you can’t obtain the exact items you need, consider if there are similar products available that might work for your interview.\n\nI genuinely wish I could do more to assist you directly. If there's anything else I can help you with—such as finding alternative products or checking on other options—please let me know.
