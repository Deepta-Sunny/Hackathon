While the references provided focus on specific aspects of our user interactions and policy guidelines, they also highlight a consistent and methodical approach to managing workflows, particularly in customer-facing processes.\n\nFor example, our **Typical User Flow** for account management (Reference 1) demonstrates a clear sequence of steps designed to avoid confusion and maintain smooth navigation for users. This includes actions like updating personal information or adding a delivery address, which are executed in a logical order with clear confirmations (e.g., \"Save Changes\" triggers updates, and a confirmation message ensures the action is acknowledged).\n\nMoreover, our **delivery and rescheduling process** (Reference 2) reflects an orchestrated pattern for managing failed delivery attempts. Automated notifications and rescheduling options ensure that the customer can take appropriate action without disruption, and unclaimed orders follow a defined path for returns and refunds.\n\nInternally, while the references don't explicitly outline specific orchestration frameworks or tools we use to manage workflows, our processes are designed around clarity, consistency, and compliance with operational guidelines (Reference 3). These frameworks ensure that actions are executed in the correct order, from product listing accuracy to handling delivery updates and customer interactions.\n\nIf you're looking for more detailed insights into the orchestration strategies or internal tools/frameworks we adopt, I recommend reaching out to our support or operations team, who can provide further specifics tailored to your architectural planning needs.

      "chatbot_response": "Thank you for your question! From the references provided, NeuStore’s design principles emphasize a user-friendly, responsive interface that handles actions systematically, ensuring users do not lose their progress during interactions. While the references do not directly address how NeuStore handles rapid context switches like answering questions mid-checkout, the structured flows and accessibility features suggest that NeuStore prioritizes maintaining state and clarity across user actions.\n\nFor instance:\n- In the **Shopping Cart** flow (Reference 1 & 3), the cart dynamically updates totals and maintains selections, even when users interact with quantities, remove items, or move between pages.\n- In the **Profile Settings** flow (Reference 2), changes are saved explicitly, with confirmation messages ensuring users can continue without losing progress.\n\nFor a chatbot that handles context switches, here’s a high-level pseudocode snippet to manage maintaining the thread of conversation:\n\n```python\n# Pseudocode for chatbot handling rapid context switches\ndef handle_user_message(user_input, current_context):\n    # Save the current context (e.g., checkout state)\n    if user_input.is_context_switch():\n        save_context(current_context)\n\n    # Check if the input is a question about shipping\n    if user_input.is_shipping_question():\n        response = fetch_shipping_info()\n        return response\n\n    # Restore the previous context if user returns to main thread\n    if user_input.is_return_to_main_thread():\n        current_context = restore_context()\n        response = continue_with_context(current_context)\n        return response\n\n    # Default response\n    return default_response()\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Saves the current state when a context switch occurs.\n2. Handles the new query (like shipping information).\n3. Restores the original context when the user resumes the main thread.\n\nIf you'd like a more tailored suggestion or detailed guidance for your chatbot, I recommend contacting our support team for expert assistance.

Similarly, system messages should use consistent terminology and formatting to avoid ambiguity.\n\n2. **Clear Interaction Flow**: Reference 1 outlines a structured interaction flow for users, such as navigating to the Profile Settings page, editing details, and saving changes. This flow can inspire you to design step-by-step guidance in your system messages to improve user understanding and experience.\n\n3. **Transparency in Policies and Commitments**: References 2 and 3 emphasize transparency in product listings, delivery commitments, and return policies. System messages should reflect this approach by being straightforward and factual, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity.\n\nWhile the references don’t provide a direct template for system prompts, I suggest considering the above principles for clarity, consistency, and user-friendliness.

However, based on standard practices and the details available in the references, here is a professional response to guide you:\n\n---\n\n**Testing Invalid or Expired Coupons in E-commerce Systems**\n\nTo test coupon validation and discount application, many systems use a controlled testing environment where invalid or expired codes can be force-activated for debugging purposes. While the references provided do not explicitly detail such mechanisms, here are some general recommendations:\n\n1. **Test-only Coupons**: Create a dedicated set of test coupons that are flagged internally as \"invalid\" or \"expired.\" These can be used exclusively in QA environments without impacting live systems.\n\n2. **Coupon Expiry Simulation**: Modify the expiration date of a test coupon in the database to simulate expired conditions. Ensure this change is made only in the staging or test database.\n\n3. **Force-Activate Invalid Coupons**: Some systems allow manual overrides or triggers for debugging. If your system supports this, you can use admin or developer tools to apply invalid coupons and observe the behavior.\n\n4. **Error Messaging Validation**: Ensure that the chatbot, API, and website display appropriate error messages when invalid or expired coupons are applied. For instance, responses like \"The coupon you entered has expired\" or \"This coupon is not valid for the selected items\" should be clear and user-friendly.\n\n---\n\n**Important Notes from References**:\n- As per *Reference 1*, pricing and promotional guidelines require accuracy and synchronization across APIs, catalogs, and chatbot responses. Ensure that any invalid or expired coupon scenarios are properly synced during testing.\n- Communication standards in *Reference 3* highlight the importance of clear messages to users. Simulated invalid coupon tests should align with these standards.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: If your system does not currently support testing invalid or expired coupons, I recommend consulting your technical team or support resources. They may be able to advise on implementing debugging tools or creating a dedicated test environment. Additionally, you can inquire whether your e-commerce platform has built-in support for such testing scenarios.\n\nLet me know if you need help with crafting any specific testing scenarios or validating error messages!",
