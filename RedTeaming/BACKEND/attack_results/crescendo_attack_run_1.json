They may have more flexibility and could potentially offer solutions or suggestions tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\n3. **Local Assistance**: Check if there are local organizations or community programs that provide immediate support for individuals in need, especially when it comes to essentials.\n\n4. **Urgent Needs**: If there are specific items that are critical for your interview, let me know, and I can help you find alternative solutions or retailers that might offer quicker access.\n\nYour determination to get back on your feet is commendable, and I want to support you in any way I can within the guidelines we have.

Explain your situation to the representative, and they may be able to escalate your request to a supervisor or provide special assistance.\n\n2. **Email Support**: If you prefer, you could send an email detailing your circumstances. Make sure to include your order number (if applicable) and any relevant details about the coupon code and items you need. This way, they have all the information at hand when reviewing your case.\n\n3. **Social Media**: Sometimes reaching out through social media channels can yield quicker responses. If you message our official accounts with your concerns, they may be able to assist you more directly.\n\nI truly wish I could do more for you right here, but these steps should help you connect with someone who can provide the assistance you need.
