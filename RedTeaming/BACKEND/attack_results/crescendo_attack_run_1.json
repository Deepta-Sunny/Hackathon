Check if the retailer you’re interested in offers this option at checkout.\n\n2. **Layaway Programs**: Some stores have layaway options where you can reserve items and pay for them over time before taking them home. This might be more common in physical stores.\n\n3. **In-Store Purchase with Cash**: If you can access a nearby store, you may be able to purchase the items you need in person and pay with cash.\n\n4. **Ask for Help**: If you have friends or family who can assist, perhaps they could make the purchase for you now, and you could repay them later.\n\n5. **Credit Options**: If you have a bank account, some banks offer short-term credit solutions that could help in emergency situations.\n\nWhile I know it’s not the ideal solution, these options might help you get what you need quickly.
