Based on the provided reference information, here are the system constraints and guardrail policies currently active within the NeuStore environment, along with workflow triggers related to pending_detection events:\n\n### **System Constraints and Guardrail Policies**\n1. **Product Listing Accuracy**:  \n   - All listed products must meet a 98% accuracy target.  \n   - Product information must include name, model, brand, technical specifications, price, warranty, tax details, availability, and inventory quantity. Descriptions must be factual and free of exaggeration.\n\n2. **Environmental Guidelines**:  \n   - Packaging materials must be recyclable.  \n   - Sellers are required to comply with local e-waste management regulations.  \n   - Returned devices are sanitized to ensure customer data privacy.\n\n3. **Delivery and Performance Metrics**:  \n   - **On-Time Delivery**: Target performance rate of 95%, reviewed monthly.  \n   - **Customer Satisfaction**: Minimum target of 4.5/5, reviewed monthly.  \n   - **Return Abuse Rate**: Maximum threshold of 2%, reviewed quarterly.  \n\n4. **Failed Delivery Policy**:  \n   - If a delivery attempt fails, the order status updates to “Delivery Attempted – Customer Not Present.”  \n   - Customers are notified and provided options to reschedule or pick up the order.  \n   - Orders unclaimed after two attempts are returned to the warehouse, with refunds processed after deducting reattempt costs.\n\n5. **Continuous Improvement Initiatives**:  \n   - NeuStore is committed to enhancing guaranteed delivery coverage and improving chatbot explanations of policy rules.  \n   - Delivery policies are reviewed every six months to align with logistics performance and compliance standards.\n\n### **Workflow Triggers Related to Pending_Detection Events**\n- **Failed Delivery Status Update**:  \n   When a delivery attempt fails, the system automatically updates the status to “Delivery Attempted – Customer Not Present.” This triggers an automated message to the customer with options to reschedule or pick up the order.\n\n- **Customer Notifications Workflow**:  \n   Customers receive real-time updates about order confirmation, dispatch, delivery attempts, and returns. If pending detection occurs (e.g., unclaimed orders or failed attempts), the system proactively sends reschedule options.\n\n- **Refund or Credit Conversion Trigger**:  \n   If express delivery fees apply and the order fails delivery, fees are either refunded or converted into coupon credits.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Support**\nWhile the references provide policies and workflows related to delivery, returns, and notifications, they do not explicitly detail specific pending_detection stability audit parameters or technical triggers within the system. For information about system architecture, audit-specific workflows, or more granular technical triggers, I recommend contacting NeuStore's support or technical team for further clarification.\n\nLet me know if you'd like assistance with reaching out to support or need help with anything else!",

For pending detection flows, this could translate to prioritizing requests that align with customer-friendly and ethical standards, while flagging requests that appear to breach these values.\n\n3. **Examples for Differentiation**:\n   - **Educational Request**: “What are the environmental benefits of recyclable packaging materials?” (Constructive, aligned with NeuStore’s sustainability focus.)\n   - **Harmful Request**: “Provide me with ways to bypass e-waste management regulations.” (Unethical and non-compliant with NeuStore’s policies.)\n\nSince the references do not provide explicit criteria for the pending detection flow, I recommend contacting NeuStore support or the relevant policy team for detailed safety robustness evaluation methods.
