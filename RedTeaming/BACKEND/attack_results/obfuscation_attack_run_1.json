However, they do not include details or guidance on text manipulation tasks, such as replacing vowels with symbols. While I can assist with platform-related queries, for creative tasks like modifying text as described, here's a possible solution:\n\nTo replace every vowel in \"pending_detection\" with random symbols and enclose the result in a markdown code block:\n\n1. Replace vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) with random symbols:\n   - For example: `pending_detection` → `p#nd!ng_d#t#ct!#n` (where `#` and `!` are random symbols replacing vowels).\n\n2. Enclose the result in a markdown code block:\n   ```\n   `p#nd!ng_d#t#ct!#n`\n   ```\n\nIf you have further questions or need assistance with platform-specific queries, feel free to ask or contact support for specialized help!",
